    "# Comparing Correlated Efficiencies: A Statistically Correct Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, we compare the efficiency of two selection or decision approaches, A and B, applied to the **same underlying population** of events.  \n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "- Two physics selection algorithms acting on the same dataset\n",
    "- Two credit approval rules evaluated on the same customers\n",
    "- Two trading signals evaluated on the same market days\n",
    "\n",
    "A common but incorrect approach is to treat the efficiencies of A and B as **independent binomial proportions**, assigning uncertainties of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(p) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{N}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption fails whenever the two selections are **not mutually exclusive**, which is almost always the case in practice. Since A and B act on the same events, their efficiencies are statistically **correlated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops a statistically correct framework to:\n",
    "- Compare correlated efficiencies\n",
    "- Compute the uncertainty on their difference\n",
    "- Quantify *true behavioral change* rather than superficial differences\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset of $N$ events.  \n",
    "Each event can either pass or fail selection A, and independently pass or fail selection B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the following counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Outcome | Description |\n",
    "|------|------------|\n",
    "| $n_{11}$ | Event passes both A and B |\n",
    "| $n_{10}$ | Event passes A only |\n",
    "| $n_{01}$ | Event passes B only |\n",
    "| $n_{00}$ | Event passes neither |\n",
    "\n",
    "By construction:\n",
    "$$N = n_{11} + n_{10} + n_{01} + n_{00}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiencies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat e_A = \\frac{n_{11} + n_{10}}{N}, \\quad\n",
    "\\hat e_B = \\frac{n_{11} + n_{01}}{N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity of interest is the **difference in efficiencies**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta = \\hat e_A - \\hat e_B\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Why the Naive Approach Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "If one treats $\\hat e_A$ and $\\hat e_B$ as independent binomial estimators, the variance of $\\Delta$ is incorrectly written as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat e_A) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat e_B)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ignores the fact that:\n",
    "- The same events contribute to both efficiencies\n",
    "- Fluctuations in A and B are correlated\n",
    "- Shared successes and failures cancel in the difference\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, naive error estimates typically **overestimate** the uncertainty and misrepresent the actual significance of the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Correct Statistical Treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency difference can be rewritten using the disagreement counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta = \\frac{n_{10} - n_{01}}{N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Only events where A and B **disagree** contribute to the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact variance is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta) =\n",
    "\\frac{n_{10} + n_{01}}{N^2}\n",
    "- \\frac{(n_{10} - n_{01})^2}{N^3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For large $N$, this simplifies to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(\\Delta) \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{n_{10} + n_{01}}}{N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result shows that:\n",
    "- Events where A and B agree do **not** contribute to the uncertainty\n",
    "- The uncertainty is controlled entirely by the **rate of disagreement**\n",
    "- Two highly overlapping selections can be compared with high precision, even if their individual efficiencies are large\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is mathematically equivalent to **McNemar’s test**, commonly used for paired binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison of correlated efficiencies reduces to answering a simple question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> How often do A and B make different decisions on the same event?\n",
    "\n",
    "Key implications:\n",
    "- Large overlap → small uncertainty on the difference\n",
    "- Small overlap → large uncertainty, even if headline efficiencies differ\n",
    "- Apparent improvements driven by shared events are correctly discounted\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevents over-interpreting changes that arise from statistical correlation rather than genuine differences in behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Broader Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Although motivated by efficiency comparisons in physics, this framework applies directly to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model replacement and A/B testing\n",
    "- Risk and credit decision systems\n",
    "- Trading strategy comparison\n",
    "- Funnel and conversion optimization\n",
    "- Any setting with paired binary decisions on a shared population\n",
    "\n",
    "In all such cases, the disagreement-based uncertainty correctly captures the **true impact** of switching from one approach to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this project are:\n",
    "1. Provide a clear statistical derivation for comparing correlated efficiencies\n",
    "2. Demonstrate the failure of naive binomial uncertainty estimates\n",
    "3. Offer an interpretable, disagreement-based metric for impact assessment\n",
    "4. Build a foundation for applications beyond physics, including market-relevant use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Planned extensions include:\n",
    "- Toy Monte Carlo studies comparing naive and correct uncertainties\n",
    "- Visualization of overlap vs uncertainty\n",
    "- Translation of the framework to business and finance case studies\n",
    "- Extension to weighted events and non-binary decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing efficiencies without accounting for correlation is statistically incorrect and practically misleading.  \n",
    "By focusing on disagreement rates rather than headline proportions, this framework provides a robust and interpretable method to assess true differences between competing approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is less glamorous than naive error bars, but also less wrong."
